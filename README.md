Deeploy is an ONNX-to-C compiler that generates low-level optimized C Code for multi-cluster, heterogeneous SoCs. Its goal is to enable configurable deployment flows from a bottom-up compiler perspective, modeling target hardware in a fine-grained and modular manner.

Deeploy is developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.

## Getting started

Installing Deeploy is as simple as running:
```
pip install -e . --extra-index-url=https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
```
However, to run the code generated by Deeploy on a certain target, you need the toolchains and the simulators associated with this platform.

We provide a Docker container where Deeploy works Out-of-the-Box (*i.e.* with all the dependencies pre-installed). To pull the docker image, run:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/pulp-platform/deeploy:main
```
Then you can start the container in interactive mode with:
```
docker run -it ghcr.io/pulp-platform/deeploy:main
```
From the container, clone Deeploy, its submodules, and install the package with:
```
git clone https://github.com/pulp-platform/Deeploy.git && cd Deeploy
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install -e . --extra-index-url=https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
```
Congratulations, you installed Deeploy and its dependencies! Now, to test your installation let's run one simple test on each platform with the following commands:
```
cd DeeployTest && source /app/install/pulp-sdk/configs/siracusa.sh
python testRunner_generic.py -t Tests/Adder
python testRunner_cortexm.py -t Tests/Adder
python testRunner_mempool.py -t Tests/Adder
python testRunner_siracusa.py -t Tests/Adder --cores=8
```

You can find the ONNX file in `DeeployTest/Tests/Adder`, to visualize it, you can use [Netron](https://netron.app/). You can also find the generated code for the platform X in `TEST_X` in `DeeployTest` and you should notice that the generated code for the `Adder` test is very simple. However, this gets more complex when you add tiling. Let's generate the code for a single layer but using tiling this time:
```
python testRunner_tiled_siracusa.py -t Tests/testMatMul --cores=8 --l1=16000
``` 
Now you can open the generated code in `DeeployTest/TEST_SIRACUSA/Tests/testMatMul/Network.c` and see how we executed a tiled layer.
